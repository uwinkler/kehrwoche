# kehrwoche

The Swabian or Württembergische Kehrwoche began at the end of the 15th century in Württemberg, to improve household cleanliness. In its original form, it imposed duties on individual households regarding order and cleanliness inside the common property within the building, like staircases or entrances, as well as outside the house, especially on public pathways and places adjacent to the house. It was a weekly duty, taken in turns, on Saturday.
